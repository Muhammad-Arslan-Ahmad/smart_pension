## Run script

1. App receives a file in parser.rb
2. If you want to run a different file, place that file in project repo or provide relative path of that file to parser.rb

By default I have added a webserver.log file.
In order to run the project use:

ruby parser.rb after bundle install
## Run specs
```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec spec
